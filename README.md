# Managing_a_directory
Directory management software with six modes: add, delete, modify, search by name or age, display by initial letter.
This project involves creating a directory management software that contains information about people such as their name, age, gender, and email address. The directory is structured as an array of 26 cells, with each cell corresponding to a letter of the alphabet, and containing a pointer to a linked list of people whose names start with that letter. The software has six modes of operation: Display, Add, Remove, Modify, Search, and Quit. The user interface will run in the console, and the user will be prompted to enter information when required. The application should be easy to navigate, and memory should be managed effectively.
